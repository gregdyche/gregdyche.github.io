# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal website repository for GitHub Pages (gregdyche.github.io). The repository is in its initial stages, containing basic documentation files and setup for a personal portfolio/blog site.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - Main project description and planning notes
- `projects.md` - Currently empty, intended for project listings
- `.gitignore` - Comprehensive Python-focused gitignore configuration

## Development Context

The owner is exploring using AI tools (Gemini or Claude CLI) to help manage project lists and tasks, as mentioned in the README planning section. The .gitignore suggests Python may be used for site generation or tooling, though no Python files exist yet.

## Project Type

This appears to be intended as a GitHub Pages site, which typically uses:
- Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend
- Possible Jekyll (Ruby) or other static site generators
- Markdown for content

## Current State

The repository is in initial setup phase with placeholder content. The projects.md file is empty and waiting for content development.
